        <h2>A Message From Me</h2>
        <p class="cursive">
    My Lovely Wife,<br><br>

    I love you, but that doesn't even come close to explaining it.
You make everything softer, the loud days quiet, the heavy days lighter, the ones where I forget how to breathe, you walk in, smile, and all of the sudden, Everything is okay again.

 
    <br><br>

    The days we don't get to see each other feel slow, but, when I get to see 
    you on the other side of my screen, all of the sudden, the days start to 
    feel better, obviously not like when we are side by side, arm in arm,
     skin on skin, but it's better. Be it watching a movie, scrolling together,
      or even just sitting on the phone in your presence, 
      all of the sudden, my days feel brighter, the warmth of your love finding me, 
      no matter the distance.
    <br><br>

    The only sad thing is, the days that I don't get to see you at all,
     those days feel dull and dim. But even on those bleh days,
      I still am happy, because knowing I have someone that it 
      hurts this much to miss makes me happy.


    <br><br>

    I don't know how I got this lucky, 
    how I get to love someone like you. But I do. And I will. 
    In every lifetime, in every version of me, I will always find you. 

    <br><br>

    My Darling,  
    I love you to infinity and beyond (and then some more).
</p>
